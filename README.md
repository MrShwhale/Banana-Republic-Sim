# Banana-Republic-Sim
Help students understand the difficulties of becoming and MEDC with this simulator game!


## Background

This is a project I made for my Computer Science IA. It is based on a board game made by my advisor, who is an economics teacher. 

## Rules

The rules of play can be found in the "Rules.pdf" file. Some minor adjustments have been made in the switch to digital, but it is mostly the same game.
