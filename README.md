# Banana-Republic-Sim
Help students understand the difficulties of becoming and MEDC with this simulator game!


## Background

This is a project I made for my Computer Science IA. It is based on a board game made by my advisor, who is an economics teacher. 

## Rules

The rules of play can be found in the "Rules.pdf" file. Some minor adjustments have been made in the switch to digital, but it is mostly the same game. 

## Running the game

To run this game, download the .zip from releases and open it. Put all three files in the same folder, and double click the .sh to run it. 

If this doesn't work, or if you are not running it on a macOS machine, then running the .jar file from a console window open to the folder should work.
